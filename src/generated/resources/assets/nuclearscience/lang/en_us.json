The core needs to be surrounded in a 5x5x2 area of water in order to be cooled:",
  "guidebook.nuclearscience.chapter.fissionreactor.l1.2": "Water placed below the core will not affect its cooling. Another item to note is that while a 5x5x2 area is the minimum required, a 7x7x2 volume is advised due to how block updates work, as the reactor will delete water sources in the cooling volume. ",
  "guidebook.nuclearscience.chapter.fissionreactor.l2": "Next, cover the top of the 5x5x2 water volume with Turbines. You can either have single turbines, or turn a group of 9 into a large 3x3 turbine using a wrench. Connect the turbines to a wire once ready:",
  "guidebook.nuclearscience.chapter.fissionreactor.l3": "Now that you have the Reactor constructed, you will need a source of heat to make the steam. This is where the Fission part of the name comes into play. The following fuel rods can be used to heat the reactor:",
  "guidebook.nuclearscience.chapter.fissionreactor.l4": "The hotter the core gets, the more steam and thus electricity it will produce. The temperature associated with each fuel type is the temperature the reactor core will reach when four rods of that type are inserted. The Core has a temperature limit of 1417 C, and going above this temperature places it at risk of melting down! The Core will not meltdown immediately if it is overheated, but the longer it runs in an overheated state, the greater the chance is of a meltdown occurring. It is also important to note that the hotter a reactor runs, the quicker the fuel source degrades! When a fuel rod is expended, it will leave behind a Spent Fuel Rod which can be processed into other valuable materials.",
  "guidebook.nuclearscience.chapter.fissionreactor.l5": "If you were paying attention, you may have noticed that a full set of some fuel rods can actually cause the reactor to meltdown. There are two ways to deal with this issue. This first is to mix and match certain fuel types. However, this method is mostly a trial-by-error approach, and does not leave a large amount of room for error.",

A full extension will result in the fission reaction halting completely.",

However, harvesting this energy is very expensive. The Fusion Reactor's ability to produce power is best understood by understanding its principles rather than understanding a rigid design like with the fission-based reactors. The core produces plasma by fusing Deuterium and Tritium together. This fusion process takes energy however, so the reactor must produce more energy than it uses to be beneficial. The plasma that is produced can only be contained by Electromagnets. The plasma on its own will do nothing, however if the plasma is underneath an electromagnet that has a water source block on top of it, the water will be boiled from the immense heat, producing steam that can spin a turbine. There is no one set design on how to achieve the full potential of the reactor, so you will have to play around with designs. The rest of this guide will cover the construction of a fairly efficient Fusion reactor. It should be noted that this design does not achieve the maximum possible energy output!",

Instead of directly heating the water using fission, the reactor uses a molten fissile material that in turns heats a conductive salt. This molten conductive salt is then passed through a heat exchanger which will in turn boil water to produce steam. This has the added benefit of not needing to have the reactor core submersed directly in water, allowing you to be flexible with turbine placement.",

This salt is supplied by the Freeze Plug. Simply make the salt and place the pellets in the Plug. The salt is not consumed by the reactor meaning you won't have to replenish it, but the more salt you add, the more heat it will be able to transfer.",
  "guidebook.nuclearscience.chapter.msreactor.l4": "The fissile salt that the Molten Salt Reactor uses is a specially prepared compound known as LiF-ThF4-UF4. However, as the name of the reactor implies, this salt must be molten in order to be useful. Place the fissile salt pellet in the Molten Salt Supplier to melt it. Each salt pellet melts to %s mB, and the core has an internal capacity of 1000 mB. The salt is slowly consumed over time and produces waste which is also collected by the supplier. Just like the Fission Reactor, the hotter the reactor, the faster the fuel is consumed.",
  "guidebook.nuclearscience.chapter.msreactor.l5": "Now that the reactor has melted the conductive salt, you need a way to move it and disperse the heat. To do this, you will need to craft some %1$s and a %2$s. The VS Pipe is connected to the top of the Reactor Core and fed into the bottom of the Heat Exchanger. The Heat Exchanger is incredibly efficient, and a single one can be sufficient. It must be placed in a 5x5x2 pool of water like the Fission Reactor Core. It should be noted that while the exchanger doesn't have to be directly above the reactor core by placing a longer VS Pipe, the longer the VS Pipe is, the more heat it will radiate away before it reaches the Exchanger!",
  "guidebook.nuclearscience.chapter.msreactor.l6": "Another perk of the MS Reactor is that is cannot melt down, making it significantly safer. However, like its predecessor, the hotter the reactor gets, the faster it burns fuel. To decrease the fuel usage, a %s can be used.

In order to facilitate a collision, both particles will need to be moving at very high speeds. This can be accomplished by passing a Particle through an Electromagnetic Booster. If the Particle and Booster are facing the same direction, the Booster will increase the Particle's speed by 0.33% for every tick the Particle is inside the Booster. If the Booster is a corner, it will increase the Particle's speed by 0.17% for every tick the Particle is inside the Booster. This means that the faster a Particle moves, the less effective each successive Booster becomes. It is important to note that moving particles emit radiation.",

  "guidebook.nuclearscience.chapter.radiation.l1.3": "It is worth noting before continuing however that the ray-casting system isn't perfect, and it will struggle in some edge cases!",
  "guidebook.nuclearscience.chapter.radiation.l2.1": "But you may be asking \"what emits radiation?\" Radiation is emitted by various items, blocks, and machines. To see how radioactive an item is, hover over it in your inventory and hold the Control key:",
  "guidebook.nuclearscience.chapter.radiation.l2.2": "It is left up to the player to discover what other sources of radiation there are! A good rule of thumb though is that if it works with radioactive materials, there is a good chance it emits radiation. A useful tool to craft early on is the %1$s. The Geiger Counter is an invaluable tool that will allow you to view the radiation exposure at a current location. When in your inventory, it will tick if exposed to radiation, making it a useful warning device. Note that Geiger Counter will consume %2$s Joules for every tick it detects radiation.",
  "guidebook.nuclearscience.chapter.radiation.l3": "Up until now, we have discussed how radiation works and what emits it, but there has been no mention of if it is possible to mitigate it. Radiation is lethal if exposed to it for long enough. Fortunately, there are various methods offered to deal with this.",
  "guidebook.nuclearscience.chapter.radiation.l4": "The first option is to consume an %1$s. Iodine Tablets offer limited radiation resistance, and are capable of protecting you from up to %2$s Rads for up to %3$s Minutes per pill. Even if you are exposed to radiation greater than what the Iodine is rated for, the tablet will still reduce received rads by %4$s. Keep in mind however that the effect is limited, so you will need to keep eating Iodine Tablets!",
  "guidebook.nuclearscience.chapter.radiation.l5": "The next option is to wear a %1$s. The Hazmat Suit is far more robust than an Iodine Tablet, and will protect you from radiation at the expense of durability. You can craft a reinforced variant with more durability, but ultimately it too can break. Fortunately, Hazmat Suits can be repaired using a %2$s in an Anvil.",
  "guidebook.nuclearscience.chapter.radiation.l6.1": "But all these options seem temporary you might be saying. \"Surely there has to be a more permanent method.\" Well, you're in luck! The third option for radiation mitigation is to use blocks that provide radiation shielding. You can view how much shielding a block provides by hovering over it in your inventory and holding the Shift key:",
  "guidebook.nuclearscience.chapter.radiation.l6.2": "Shielding functions as an impediment, and will reduce radiation by the value displayed. When placing radiation shielding, it is important to remember that the radiation system takes height into account as discussed earlier. Remember the 300 Rad source we previously used? If you only place one block of shielding, it will only shield you from half the radiation:",
  "guidebook.nuclearscience.chapter.radiation.l6.3": "If you wanted to fully shield yourself using blocks, you would need to use two due to the player being two blocks tall:",
  "guidebook.nuclearscience.chapter.radiation.l7": "But what to do if all of this fails? What happens if you get exposed to radiation even after all of these precautions. To remove the radiation effect, you can consume %s, which will remove the radiation effect completely. Antidote is extracted from fish for reference.",
  "guidebook.nuclearscience.chapter.radiation.l8": "Nuclear Science also offers machines that can help mitigate radiation exposure. The first of these is the %1$s. The Cloud Chamber, if powered and supplied with liquid Methanol, will show all radiation sources around it in a %2$s block radius. Sources will appear as a highlighted outline. The Chamber can be toggled using a redstone signal, and will identify how many sources it has detected via its GUI.",
  "guidebook.nuclearscience.chapter.radiation.l9": "The second machine that is offered is the %1$s. To understand the Fallout Scrubber, you must first understand one of the underlying mechanics for radiation. Nuclear has three types of radiation sources: permanent, temporary, and fading. Permanent sources will never dissipate and are permanent scars on the environment. Temporary sources are similar to permanent sources, however they will eventually dissipate over time. The final source is a fading radiation source. Fading radiation sources will slowly be whittled down by their environment. The default dissipation rate is %2$s Rad/tick, and can be altered in the settings. The Fallout Scrubber will increase the rateof dissipation in a %3$s block radius around it by %4$s Rad/tick. This effect stacks with other scrubbers, but will only affect fading radiation sources. The Scrubber needs Water and Decontamination Foam to work.",

  "guidebook.nuclearscience.chapter.radiogen.l1": "The Radioisotropic Generator presents an alternative to a fission reaction to produce electricity. It instead uses the natural heat produced from the radioactive decay of items to directly generate electricity. Simply place a radioactive item in it, and it will begin to generate power. The more radioactive an item is, and the more of said item there is, the more power will be produced!",
  "guidebook.nuclearscience.chapter.steamfunnel": "Steam Funnel",
  "guidebook.nuclearscience.chapter.steamfunnel.l1": "The steam funnel provides you a way to transport the steam that is produced by the various reactors in Nuclear Science. To collect steam, place the funnel where a turbine would traditionally go. You can then connect a gas pipe to the top. To release the steam into a turbine,place a turbine on top of a funnel, and connect a gas pipe into the bottom. Note the steam inside of the gas pipe will not cool, however it is incredibly hot, making it very difficult to store.",

  "guidebook.nuclearscience.chapter.turbines.l1": "Steam Turbines are what actually produce power in Nuclear Science. Turbines will produce at different voltages depending on what temperature of steam is venting through them. Turbines produce the following voltages under the following temperatures: ",
  "guidebook.nuclearscience.chapter.turbines.l2": "This relationship is important, as Turbines produce more power the faster they spin. However, the only way to spin a turbine faster is to vent more steam through it. This means that as a turbine spins faster, it will produce more power, but also at an ever-increasing voltage. This can become a major problem, especially in situations like a melting-down reactor, as not only will the reactor explode, but also any machinery that is connected downstream!",
  "guidebook.nuclearscience.chapter.turbines.l3": "To get power out of a turbine, connect a wire to the top of one. A 3x3 group of turbines can be upgraded into a large turbine by whacking the center one with a wrench.",
