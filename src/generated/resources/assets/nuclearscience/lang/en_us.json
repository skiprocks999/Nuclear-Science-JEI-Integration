The Hazmat Suit is far more robust than an Iodine Tablet, and will protect you from radiation at the expense of durability. You can craft a reinforced variant with more durability, but ultimately it too can break. Fortunately, Hazmat Suits can be repaired using a %2$s in an Anvil.",
  "guidebook.nuclearscience.chapter.radiation.l6.1": "But all these options seem temporary you might be saying. \"Surely there has to be a more permanent method.\" Well, you're in luck! The third option for radiation mitigation is to use blocks that provide radiation shielding. You can view how much shielding a block provides by hovering over it in your inventory and holding the Shift key:",
  "guidebook.nuclearscience.chapter.radiation.l6.2": "Shielding functions as an impediment, and will reduce radiation by the value displayed. When placing radiation shielding, it is important to remember that the radiation system takes height into account as discussed earlier. Remember the 300 Rad source we previously used? If you only place one block of shielding, it will only shield you from half the radiation:",
  "guidebook.nuclearscience.chapter.radiation.l6.3": "If you wanted to fully shield yourself using blocks, you would need to use two:",
  "guidebook.nuclearscience.chapter.radiation.l7": "But what to do if all of this fails? What happens if you get exposed to radiation even after all of these precautions. To remove the radiation effect, you can consume %s, which will remove the radiation effect completely. Antidote is extracted from fish, so you will probably want to get good at fishing!",

It instead uses the natural heat produced from the radioactive decay of items to directly generate electricity. Simply place a radioactive item in it, and it will begin to generate power. The more radioactive an item is, and the more of said item there is, the more power will be produced!",

Turbines will produce at different voltages depending on what temperature of steam is venting through them. Turbines produce the following voltages under the following temperatures: ",
  "guidebook.nuclearscience.chapter.turbines.l2": "This relationship is important, as Turbines produce more power the faster they spin. However, the only way to spin a turbine faster is to vent more steam through it. This means that as a turbine spins faster, it will produce more power, but also at an ever-increasing voltage. This can become a major problem, especially in situations like a melting-down reactor, as not only will the reactor explode, but also any machinery that is connected downstream!",
